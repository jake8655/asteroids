  <h1>Asteroids</h1>
</div>
Asteroids is a very small and simple game.
You play as a spaceship shooting asteroids and have a score counting how many you have successfully destroyed/missed.

It was my very first game that I made in [MonoGame](https://monogame.net) in 2021.

## Download
You can download the game [from itch.io](https://jake8655.itch.io/asteroids).
